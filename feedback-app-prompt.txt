Feedback Management WebApp

Goal:
Build a standalone feedback management system where students can submit feedback (Content Errors, Feature Requests, Bug Reports) across multiple programs (e.g., NIAT, Intensive, Academy). Feedbacks flow through auditors, teams, and leads until resolution. Admins and co-admins oversee the system with full modular dashboards and dynamic form-building.
