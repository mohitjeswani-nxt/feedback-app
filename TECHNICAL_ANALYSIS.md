# Feedback Management System - Technical Analysis & Documentation

## Overview

This is a comprehensive enterprise-grade feedback management system built for educational institutions using modern web technologies. The application handles student feedback submission, team-based resolution workflows, and administrative oversight through a sophisticated role-based architecture.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend:**

- Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling with Radix UI components
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Clerk for authentication

**Backend:**

- Next.js API Routes for server-side logic
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Svix for webhook verification
- File handling simulation (ready for cloud storage integration)

## Authentication Architecture

### Clerk Integration

The application uses Clerk as the authentication provider with the following flow:

1. **User Registration/Login** → Clerk handles OAuth and email authentication
2. **Webhook Synchronization** → User data synced to MongoDB via webhooks
3. **Profile Setup** → Role-based profile completion for new users
4. **Session Management** → JWT token validation on all protected routes
5. **Role-Based Routing** → Automatic redirection to appropriate dashboards

### Security Implementation

- JWT validation on every API request
- Role-based access control at the API level
- Webhook signature verification using Svix
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive audit logging

## User Roles & Permissions

### 6 Distinct User Roles:

1. **Student**: Submit feedback, track personal submissions
2. **Auditor**: Review submissions, assign to teams, set priorities/SLA
3. **Team Member**: Work on assigned feedback, update status, document solutions
4. **Team Lead**: Manage team assignments, approve resolutions
5. **Admin**: Complete system administration, user management, form templates
6. **Co-Admin**: Administrative support with similar permissions to Admin

### Permission Matrix:

- Students can only submit and view their own feedback
- Auditors manage the assignment process and system oversight
- Team members handle resolution work within their assigned items
- Team leads manage team workflow and approve completed work
- Admins have full system access and configuration capabilities

## API Architecture

### Core Endpoints:

**Authentication:**

- `GET/PUT /api/users/profile` - User profile management
- `POST /api/webhooks/clerk` - Clerk user synchronization

**Feedback Management:**

- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit feedback (Students only)
- `GET /api/feedback` - Retrieve feedback (role-filtered)
- `PUT /api/feedback/update-status` - Status updates
- `POST /api/feedback/assign` - Team assignment (Auditors)
- `POST /api/feedback/assign-member` - Member assignment (Team Leads)
- `POST /api/feedback/approve-resolution` - Resolution approval

**Administration:**

- `GET /api/admin/users` - User management
- `GET /api/admin/audit-logs` - System audit trail
- `POST /api/admin/notifications/broadcast` - System notifications

**Form Templates:**

- `GET /api/form-templates/program/{program}` - Dynamic form loading
- CRUD operations for form template management

### API Design Patterns:

- Consistent authentication validation
- Role-based access control
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit logging for all operations
- RESTful design principles

## Database Models

### Key Data Structures:

**User Model:**

```typescript
interface User {
  clerkId: string; // Primary authentication link
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: UserRole; // 6 possible roles
  program?: ProgramType; // For students
  teamId?: ObjectId; // Team assignment
  // Additional role-specific fields
}
```

**Feedback Model:**

```typescript
interface Feedback {
  ticketId: string; // Auto-generated unique ID
  studentId: string; // Submitter
  program: ProgramType; // NIAT, Intensive, Academy

  // Content fields
  course: string;
  unit: string;
  issueDescription: string;

  // Workflow tracking
  status: FeedbackStatus; // 7 possible statuses
  priority: Priority; // 4 priority levels

  // Assignment tracking
  assignedTeamId?: ObjectId;
  assignedMemberId?: ObjectId;

  // SLA management
  slaHours?: number;
  slaDeadline?: Date;

  // File attachments
  screenshots: string[];
  video?: string;
}
```

**Dynamic Form Templates:**

```typescript
interface FormTemplate {
  programType: string; // Program-specific forms
  fields: FormField[]; // Dynamic field definitions
  isActive: boolean;
  version: number;
}
```

## Application Flow

### Student Submission Flow:

1. Student authenticates and accesses role-specific dashboard
2. System loads program-specific dynamic form template
3. Student completes form with optional file uploads
4. Submission creates unique ticket ID and notifies auditors
5. Student can track progress through status updates

### Resolution Workflow:

1. **Submitted** → Auditor reviews and assigns to team
2. **Assigned** → Team lead assigns to specific member
3. **Pending** → Team member begins work
4. **In Progress** → Active resolution development
5. **Resolved** → Solution submitted for approval
6. **Completed** → Team lead approves and closes ticket

Alternative path: **No Issue Found** for invalid submissions
